# Custom Activation Function in Neural Networks

This is a project that implements a neural network with a custom activation function in the hidden layer using TensorFlow/Keras. In this approach, the activation function is designed to be flexible, where it learns its shape based on training data. Two parameters, k0 and k1, control how the input is scaled and shifted, allowing the model to adjust its behavior more efficiently as training progresses.

The model is trained on the MNIST dataset and achieves over 93% accuracy on the test set. The custom activation function allows the network to adapt and improve performance during training.
